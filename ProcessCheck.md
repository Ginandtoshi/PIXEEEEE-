# Meeting Notes


## Initial Ideation
So for our brainstorming, we each came up with a series of keywords and mixed them. After randomly choosing 5 keywords out of the pile, we would try to link them and sort out a problem/theme with an interesting output, basically the [SGDs game](https://2030sdgsgame.com/), but simplified. Here are our groups of keywords
| Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | Group 4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Pomodoro<br>2. Automation<br>3. Relax / Leisure<br>4. Simulation | 1. dock<br>2. Prison Break<br>3. currency<br>4. nervous system<br>5. mouth | 1、Tool Alienation<br>2、Data Leviathan<br>3、喇嘛辩经 (Lama Buddhist debate)<br>4、distracted<br>5、Wandering | 1. Free will<br>2. Pythagoreanism<br>3. Wood-crafting<br>4. McDonald's<br>5. Coffin |

## Meeting 1 at October 31st.
We narrowed and settled down our idea, rationale, and inital rough framework for the mechanism. We then create a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aEJvqby4MpUu6fafqfanbBQbTC_PX6k7si9ylCiqBek/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to manage our to-do and tasks distribution.
